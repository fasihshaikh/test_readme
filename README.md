# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
We have analysed multiple columns in EDA to gain more knowledge about the given dataset.

### Status:
We have 3 unique values in the Status column:

- Repaid: Loan repayment is the act of settling an amount borrowed from a lender along with the applicable interest amount.
- Late: The loan has one or more interest payments which are late. Overdue â€“ there has been a delay of more than a day on the scheduled repayment date of the loan.
- Current: Current means The borrower is making payments on time. Grace period is a set number of days after the due date during which payment may be made by the borrower without penalty.
### Gender:
- Encoded gendor column with 0 and 1 and then checked the corelation with Status column.
- Then we also checked the corelation of Status, Gender and interest columns in the barplots.
- Checked the visual representation of Status, Gender and Age column all together.
### Country:
- Checked the visual representation of Status counts with respect to Country.
### Education:
- Checked the visual representation of gendor counts with respect to level of Education.
- Then also checked the Status counts with respect to level of Education.
